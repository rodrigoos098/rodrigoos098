### 👋 hi, i am rodrigo ツ

today, i'm 27, and my programming journey started early.

i had access to a computer since i was a toddler and always loved games. at 8, before knowing what programming was, i tried to create my first game using only windows paint. my theory was simple: games are photos that move when i press a button. i drew a ball between two lines, copied it and moved it a few pixels. i did this 20 times. if i pressed the arrow in the photo viewer, the ball would 'walk'. it worked! well, until i tried to make it go up and down. it was my first lesson on states and logic, years before variables. my game failed, but my curiosity didn't.

as a teenager, i found the right tools. from pascal to c and c++, i built my logic foundation. then came years of game development: gamemaker, rpgmaker, unity, and unreal engine (i even explored 3d modeling). although i didn't stay in gamedev, those prototypes gave me a strong foundation in software architecture and optimization. that period shaped me as a performance-focused developer, mostly because my pc was modest, so efficiency was a necessity.

in college, studying computer science, i worked with python, java, sql, and formal paradigms. the path wasn't linear, and i switched courses midway (i'm now finishing information systems). for the past 3 years, i've worked as a full-stack developer at são cristóvão city hall. there i deepened my practical web development skills, building real systems and applying performance and usability concepts at scale. the transition from game experiments to web solutions was significant, but the optimization mindset stayed the same.

currently, i focus my studies on security to build more solid and resilient applications. i also explore the integration of artificial intelligence into real workflows, seeking to understand the logic behind these tools. my goal is simple: to keep evolving technically and mastering every layer of the software i deliver.
